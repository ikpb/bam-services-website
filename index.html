                <p class="about-content">Growing up in the country, it was normal to see neighbors helping one another around the community. From fixing a tractor for the local farmer to installing a new fence for Mrs. Buckley, everyone chipped in to keep the community going. In the city, however, it became clear that the way of life many of us were use to living didn’t quite fit in with the way things were done now.</p>
                <p class="about-content">A clogged toilet - fixed with a mechanical coat hanger - costs over a hundred dollars. Painting an accent wall could easily burn two hundred dollars or more into someone’s pocket, and getting someone to mow your lawn because you have work meant spending the equivalent of ten hours of wages to pay for it.</p>
                <p class="about-content">So we decided to create B.A.M Services - a repair and maintenance service with the sole purpose of solving common household issues. We take the hassle out of home ownership by offering a one-stop shop for common household problems - relieving stress and worry about on-going maintenance issues while delivering affordable and quality results.</p>
                <p class="about-content">We take pride in the fact that our prices are arguably the lowest in the area because we only charge the cost of materials plus labor is a simple, flat-price - giving customers peace of mind and savings like nothing else!</p>
